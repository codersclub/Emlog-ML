# &#x1f352; API application: applet

EmlogPro officially released the Api interface, which is more convenient to use than the previous plug-in version of Brief, so I re-wrote another program, also called Brief. Brirf-5.0 is developed with uni-app, compatible with Android, iOS, and applets
The Api interface of Rro is not perfect, so the functions implemented may not be as many as the old version. When the new interface is released, I will update it as soon as possible!
